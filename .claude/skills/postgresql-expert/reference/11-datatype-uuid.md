# 8.12. UUID Type

The `uuid` data type stores Universally Unique Identifiers as defined by RFC 9562 and related standards. Some systems refer to this as a globally unique identifier (GUID).

## Overview

A UUID is a 128-bit quantity generated by algorithm to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems. As noted in the documentation, "these identifiers provide a better uniqueness guarantee than sequence generators, which are only unique within a single database."

PostgreSQL supports native generation using UUIDv4 and UUIDv7 algorithms, though UUID values can originate from external sources using any algorithm.

## Format

Standard UUID format consists of lowercase hexadecimal digits in groups separated by hyphens: 8 digits, three groups of 4 digits, and a group of 12 digits (32 total digits).

Example: `a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11`

## Alternative Input Formats

PostgreSQL accepts several variations for input:
- Uppercase digits
- Standard format surrounded by braces
- Omitted hyphens
- Additional hyphens after any four-digit group

Output is always rendered in standard form.

## Generation

Refer to Section 9.14 of the PostgreSQL documentation for UUID generation functions and methods.
