# Chapter 1. Getting Started

This introductory chapter of the PostgreSQL 18 documentation covers fundamental topics for new users getting started with PostgreSQL.

## Table of Contents

The chapter is organized into four main sections:

1. **Installation** - Guidance on setting up PostgreSQL on your system
2. **Architectural Fundamentals** - Core concepts underlying PostgreSQL's design and operation
3. **Creating a Database** - Steps for initializing your first database
4. **Accessing a Database** - Methods for connecting to and interacting with databases

## Overview

This tutorial section provides foundational knowledge needed to begin working with PostgreSQL. It progresses from installation through basic architectural understanding, then moves into practical tasks like database creation and access.

The documentation is available across multiple supported PostgreSQL versions (currently 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14), with access to both development versions and historical documentation for earlier releases.
