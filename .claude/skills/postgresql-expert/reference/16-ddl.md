# Chapter 5. Data Definition

## Overview

This chapter explains how to establish database structures for storing data. As a relational database management system, PostgreSQL organizes raw data within tables. The majority of this content focuses on creating and modifying tables, along with available features for controlling data storage.

## Main Topics

The chapter covers the following sections:

- **Table Basics** — Foundational concepts for table creation
- **Default Values** — Setting automatic values for columns
- **Identity Columns** — Auto-incrementing column functionality
- **Generated Columns** — Computed column values
- **Constraints** — Data validation rules including check constraints, not-null constraints, unique constraints, primary keys, foreign keys, and exclusion constraints
- **System Columns** — Special columns managed by PostgreSQL
- **Modifying Tables** — Altering table structure through adding/removing columns and constraints, changing defaults and data types, and renaming elements
- **Privileges** — Access control mechanisms
- **Row Security Policies** — Row-level access restrictions
- **Schemas** — Organizing database objects into logical namespaces
- **Inheritance** — Table inheritance patterns
- **Table Partitioning** — Distributing large tables across multiple physical structures
- **Foreign Data** — External data source integration
- **Other Database Objects** — Additional structural elements
- **Dependency Tracking** — Managing object relationships

The chapter concludes by discussing how to organize tables through schemas, assign access privileges, and explore related features including views, functions, and triggers.
