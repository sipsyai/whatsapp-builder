# Develop with Redis

This documentation page serves as a foundational guide for building applications with Redis.

## Overview

The page introduces developers to Redis fundamentals, offering quick-start resources and practical examples across multiple programming languages.

## Key Sections

**Getting Started Resources**
The documentation emphasizes getting a Redis instance running quickly through either "a free trial of Redis Cloud" or installing Redis Open Source locally. Developers can then explore using their preferred programming language or UI management tools.

**Supported Programming Languages**
The guide provides client library documentation and examples for:
- Python
- C#/.NET
- Node.js
- Java
- Go
- PHP

Each language section includes examples for document search, vector search, and connection operations.

**Developer Tools**
Two primary tools are highlighted:
- **Redis Insight**: A visual client for database creation, management, and analysis
- **Redis for VS Code**: A VS Code extension offering similar functionality

## Content Organization

The main documentation is organized into logical categories:
- Quick starts
- Data types (strings, JSON, hashes, vector sets, probabilistic types)
- Vector database and RAG implementation
- Query engine and indexing
- Search and query capabilities

The page includes a sample Redis CLI demonstration showing basic command syntax for operations like PING, HSET, and mathematical functions.
