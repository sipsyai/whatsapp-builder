# Template Messages

**Updated: Nov 4, 2025**

Template messages are used to send templates to WhatsApp users. Templates can cover customer care messages, appointment reminders, payment and shipping updates, and much more.

Templates are reusable and can be sent to WhatsApp users outside of a customer service window, however they must be approved before they can be sent in a template message. Templates are also subject to multiple processes that can affect your ability to send them to users, such as quality scores, pausing, and pacing.

Because there's a lot to know about templates, we have dedicated Templates documentation that explains how to use them effectively.
