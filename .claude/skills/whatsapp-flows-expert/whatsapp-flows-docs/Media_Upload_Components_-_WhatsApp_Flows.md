# Media Upload Components - WhatsApp Flows - Documentation - Meta for Developer

WhatsApp does not guarantee that data (such as images, videos, or documents) shared with you by your customers is non-malicious. Make sure to implement appropriate risk mitigations when processing such data (for example, using well-tested and up-to-date media and document processing libraries).

Media upload components are not supported by the On-Premise API client. Please refer to the [deprecation announcent](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/sunset/) and learn how to [migrate to Cloud API.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/migrating-from-onprem-to-cloud)

## Flow JSON components

Two components can be used to ask users to upload media

-   PhotoPicker: allows uploading media from camera or gallery
-   DocumentPicker: allows uploading media from files or gallery

## PhotoPicker

Supported starting with Flow JSON version 4.0

This property determines whether the component is optional (set to 0) or required (set above 0).

Default value: 0  
Allowed range: \[0, 30\]  

Note: Above limits apply if media files are sent to the endpoint via "data\_exchange" action. For images or documents sent as part of the response message, no more of 10 files can be attached. Additionally, the aggregated size of them cannot exceed 100 MiB.

 |
 

```
max-uploaded-photos
```

Integer

 |

The format for Object is the following:  
{"media\_id\_1" : "error\_message 1", "media\_id\_2" : "error\_message 2"}

## Handling media

## Endpoint

Media uploaded by the users are temporarily (up to 20 days) stored in WhatsApp CDN. Files are encrypted using AES256-CBC+HMAC-SHA256+pkcs7 cryptographic algorithms.

In your endpoint implementation, you must download, decrypt, and validate each media file.

Here’s a payload example for a photo or document.

```
"photo\_picker":\[{
     "media\_id": "790aba14-5f4a-4dbd-aa9e-0d75401da14b",
     "cdn\_url": "https://mmg.whatsapp.net/v/redacted",
     "file\_name": "IMG\_5237.jpg"
     "encryption\_metadata": {
       "encrypted\_hash": "/QvkBvpBED2q2AHPIFuhXfLpkn22zj2kO6ggzjvhHv0=",
       "iv": "5SHjLrrsfPXTSJTcbrVSkg==",
       "encryption\_key": "lPa4SXcWbk3sy2so3OxjyXmpV4aE6CcIKd+4byr5hBw=",
       "hmac\_key": "15l+E9Z5gcL15WH9OQ8GgK7VVCKkfbVigoSiM9djvGU=",
       "plaintext\_hash": "AOF2dHXVEpm9efk9udNy3R1cUJWnpjFwQKGBEdALqXI="
     }\]
    
```

### **Decrypting and validating media**

The files stored in WhatsApp CDN contain the encrypted media and the first 10 bytes of the HMAC-SHA256 (concatenated at the end). For reference, cdn\_file = ciphertext & hmac10

Perform the following steps to decrypt the media:

1.  Download cdn\_file file from cdn\_url
2.  Make sure SHA256(cdn\_file) == enc\_hash
3.  Validate HMAC-SHA256  1.  Calculate HMAC with hmac\_key, initialization vector (encryption\_metadata.iv) and ciphertex
      2.  Make sure first 10 bytes == hmac10
    
4.  Decrypt media content  1.  Run AES with CBC mode and initialization vector (encryption\_metadata.iv) on ciphertex
      2.  Remove padding (AES256 uses blocks of 16 bytes, padding algorithm is pkcs7). We’ll call this decrypted\_media
    
5.  Validate the decrypted media
  10.   Make sure SHA256(decrypted\_media) = plaintext\_hash

## Response message (Cloud API)

Media can be received in the [response message webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/responsemsgwebhook).

Here’s a truncated example using PhotoPicker (same structure for DocumentPicker)

```
{
    "nfm\_reply": {
        // \[... redacted ... \]
        "response\_json": {
            "photo\_picker": \[
                {
                    "file\_name": "IMG\_5237.jpg",
                    "mime\_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "sha256": "PqHgadp8cJ/N6mvAYGNMxhs9Ra5hbZFcctCtCClXsMU=",
                    "id": "3631120727156756"
                }
            \],
            "flow\_token": "xyz",
            "name": "John"
        }
    }
}
    
```

The media can be downloaded following the same [steps as for regular image and document messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/media/#download-media).
