## Webhook Setup

### Create an Endpoint

Before you can start receiving notifications you will need to create an endpoint on your server to receive notifications.

Your endpoint must be able to process two types of HTTPS requests: Verification Requests and Event Notifications. Since both requests use HTTPs, your server must have a valid TLS or SSL certificate correctly configured and installed. Self-signed certificates are not supported.

[Learn more about Verifying Requests and Event Notifications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started#create-endpoint)

#### Sample App Endpoints

To test your Webhooks, you can create a [sample app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sample-app-endpoints) with an endpoint for receiving notifications.

### Subscribe to Webhooks

Once your endpoint is ready, go to your App Dashboard. If you do not have app, [create a Business Type App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app). In your App Dashboard, find the WhatsApp product and click **Configuration.** Then, find the webhooks section and select **Configure a webhook.** A dialog will then appear asking you for the following:

-   Callback URL: The URL WhatsApp will be sending the events to. This is the endpoint you have created above
    
-   Verify Token: Set up when you create your webhook endpoint

After adding the information, click **Verify and Save.**

Back in the App Dashboard, click **WhatsApp > Configuration** on the left-side panel. From there, select **Webhooks > Manage.** A dialog box will open with all the objects you can get notified about. To receive messages from your users, click **Subscribe** for **flows** AND **messages**.

A Meta App can have only one endpoint configured. If you need to send your webhook updates to multiple endpoints, you need multiple Meta Apps.

If you are a Solution Partner, you may need to:

1.  [Add the 
    ```
    whatsapp_business_messaging
    ```
     permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard#app-review) in your App Dashboard
2.  [Successfully complete Meta App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) – This step will take time but you can continue to test during the entire review process.

To get Webhook events for a specific WABA, you must [explicitly subscribe to that WABA](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/whatsapp-business-accounts#waba-subscriptions).

## Flow Response Message Webhook

When user completes the flow, a message is sent to WhatsApp chat. You will receive that message through a webhook which you normally use to process chat messages from the user. Below is the structure of flow response message webhook payload:

```
{
  "messages": \[{
    "context": {
      "from": "16315558151",
      "id": "gBGGEiRVVgBPAgm7FUgc73noXjo"
    },
    "from": "<USER\_ACCOUNT\_NUMBER>",
    "id": "<MESSAGE\_ID>",
    "type": "interactive",
    "interactive": {
      "type": "nfm\_reply",
      "nfm\_reply": {

## Types of Webhook Notifications

### Status Change Webhook

A notification is sent when the status for the flow changes, specifically when the flow is either 
```
Published
```
, 
```
Throttled
```
, 
```
Blocked
```
 or 
```
Deprecated.
```

```
{
  "entry": \[
      {
        "id": "644600416743275",
        "time": 1684969340,
        "changes": \[
          {
            "value": {
              "event": "FLOW\_STATUS\_CHANGE",
              "message": "Flow Webhook 3 changed status from DRAFT to PUBLISHED",
              "flow\_id": "6627390910605886",
              "old\_status": "DRAFT",
              "new\_status": "PUBLISHED"
            },
            "field": "flows"
          }
        \]
      }
    \],
    "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

The notification is also sent on the flow creation event. In this case the old status value will not be set, and the new value will be 
```
Draft
```
 as a default status.

```
{
  "entry": \[
      {
        "id": "644600416743275",
        "time": 1684969340,
        "changes": \[
          {
            "value": {
              "event": "FLOW\_STATUS\_CHANGE",
              "message": "Flow Webhook 3 has been created with DRAFT status",
              "flow\_id": "6627390910605886",
              "new\_status": "DRAFT"
            },
            "field": "flows"
          }
        \]
      }
    \],
    "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

### Client Error Rate Webhook

Client error rate is approximate as it’s not available for all the client devices and regions.

A notification is sent to you when the error rate for screen navigations on the client goes over one of the following thresholds and then again when it goes below these thresholds.

Error rate thresholds:

-   5%
-   10%
-   50%

The detection period for these thresholds is 60 minutes, which is the period that we calculate the error rate. WhatsApp will only send a webhook if the error rate of the events in the past 60 minutes reaches any of these thresholds or goes below them.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Check the errors listed in the alert and check the [error codes reference guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/error-codes#webhookerrors) for possible resolutions.
```
{
  "entry": \[
    {
      "id": "106181168862417",
      "time": 1674160476,
      "changes": \[
        {
          "value": {
            "event": "CLIENT\_ERROR\_RATE",
            "message": "The flow client request error rate has reached the 5% threshold in the last 60 minutes. A higher error rate will make it harder for users to complete the flow, resulting in drop-offs.",
            "flow\_id": "691244242662581",
            "error\_rate": 14.28,
            "threshold": 10,
            "alert\_state": "ACTIVATED",
            "errors": \[
              {
                "error\_type": "INVALID\_SCREEN\_TRANSITION",
                "error\_rate": 66.66,
                "error\_count": 2
              },
              {
                "error\_type": "PUBLIC\_KEY\_MISSING",
                "error\_rate": 33.33,
                "error\_count": 1
              },
            \],
          },
          "field": "flows"
        }
      \]
    }
  \],
  "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

### Endpoint Error Rate Webhook

A notification is sent to you when the error rate for endpoint requests goes over one of the following thresholds and then again when it goes below these thresholds.

Error rate thresholds:

-   5%
-   10%
-   50%

The detection period for these thresholds is 30 minutes, which is the period that we calculate the error rate. WhatsApp will only send a webhook if the error rate of the events in the past 30 minutes reaches any of these thresholds or goes below them.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Check the errors listed in the alert and check the [error codes reference guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/error-codes#webhookerrors) for possible resolutions.
```
{
  "entry": \[
    {
      "id": "106181168862417",
      "time": 1674160476,
      "changes": \[
        {
          "value": {
            "event": "ENDPOINT\_ERROR\_RATE",
            "message": "The flow endpoint request error rate has reached the 10% threshold in the last 30 minutes. A higher error rate will make it harder for users to complete the flow, resulting in drop-offs.",

            "error\_rate": 14.28,
            "threshold": 10,
            "alert\_state": "ACTIVATED",
            "errors": \[
              {
                "error\_type": "CAPABILITY\_ERROR",
                "error\_rate": 66.66,
                "error\_count": 2
              },
              {
                "error\_type": "TIMEOUT",
                "error\_rate": 33.33,
                "error\_count": 1
              },
            \],
          },
          "field": "flows"
        }
      \]
    }
  \],
  "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

### Endpoint Latency Webhook

A notification is sent to you when the p90 latency for endpoint requests goes over one of these thresholds and then again when it goes below these thresholds.

p90 latency thresholds:

-   1s
-   5s
-   7s

The detection period for these thresholds is 30 minutes, which is the period that we calculate the latency. WhatsApp will only send a webhook if the latency of the events in the past 30 minutes reaches any of these thresholds or goes below them.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Improve responsiveness of your endpoint and aim to return response in less than 1 second.
```
{
  "entry": \[
    {
      "id": "106181168862417",
      "time": 1674160476,
      "changes": \[
        {
          "value": {
            "event": "ENDPOINT\_LATENCY",
            "message": "Flow endpoint latency has reached the p90 threshold in the last 30 minutes. High latency will increase the loading time between screens in the flow, impacting user experience.",
            "flow\_id": "691244242662581",
            "p90\_latency": 8000,
            "p50\_latency": 500,
            "requests\_count": 34,
            "threshold": 7000,
            "alert\_state": "ACTIVATED",
          },
          "field": "flows"
        }
      \]
    }
  \],
  "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

### Endpoint Availability Webhook

A notification is sent to you when the the endpoint availability goes below 90% threshold and then again when it goes above the threshold.

The detection period for the alert is 10 minutes.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Ensure that your endpoint is available all the time and reachable from the internet.
-   Check that it can correctly responds to [health check requests](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/encryptedsecuredatachannel#h).
```
{
  "entry": \[
    {
      "id": "106181168862417",
      "time": 1674160476,
      "changes": \[
        {
          "value": {
            "event": "ENDPOINT\_AVAILABILITY",
            "message": "The flow endpoint availability has breached the 90% threshold in the last 10 minutes. Users will be unable to open or use the flow.",
            "flow\_id": "12345678",
            "alert\_state: "ACTIVATED",
            "availability": 75,
            "threshold" : 90,
          },
          "field": "flows"
        }

      \]
    }
  \],
  "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

### Flow Version Freeze/Expiry warning Webhook

A notification is sent to you on the flow creation event if any of the [versions used is about to be frozen](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/versioning#version-support-and-lifecycle). You won't be able to publish the Flow after the version freezes.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Please migrate to the [recommended version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/changelogs#currently-supported-versions) as soon as possible.
```
{
  "entry": \[
      {
        "id": "644600416743275",
        "time": 1684969340,
        "changes": \[
          {
            "value": {
              "event": "FLOW\_STATUS\_CHANGE",
              "message": "Flow Webhook 3 has been created with DRAFT status",
              "flow\_id": "6627390910605886",
              "new\_status": "DRAFT"
              "warning": "Your current Flow version will freeze in 21 days. You won't be able to send the Flow after it expires. Please migrate to the recommended version as soon as possible. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/changelogs#currently-supported-versions" 
            },
            "field": "flows"
          }
        \]
      }
    \],
    "object": "whatsapp\_business\_account"
}
```

The notification is also sent when you send Flow with [version which is about to expire](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/versioning#version-support-and-lifecycle). You won't be able to send the Flow after it expires.

We aim to send only single webhook per each Flow which version is about to expire.

#### Possible resolutions

-   Please migrate to the [recommended version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/changelogs#currently-supported-versions) as soon as possible.
